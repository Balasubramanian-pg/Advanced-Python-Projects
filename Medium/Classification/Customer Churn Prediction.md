# Sony Research: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

### **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze a telecom customer dataset to understand the key drivers of customer churn and to build a predictive model that can identify customers at high risk of leaving. By accurately forecasting churn, the company can proactively engage with at-risk customers through targeted retention campaigns, thereby reducing revenue loss and improving customer loyalty.

### **1. Setup and Data Generation**

First, we will set up our environment by importing the necessary libraries and generating a sample dataset.

#### **1.1. Import Libraries**
```python
# Core libraries for data handling
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Preprocessing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Models
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# Evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix, precision_recall_curve

# Set plot style and display options
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 7)
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
```

#### **1.2. Generate Sample Dataset**
This code creates `Data_Science_Challenge.csv` with realistic data and relationships.
```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
N_SAMPLES = 5000

# --- Generate Data ---
states = ['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DE', 'FL', 'GA']
data = {
    'State': np.random.choice(states, N_SAMPLES),
    'Account length': np.random.randint(1, 240, N_SAMPLES),
    'Area code': np.random.choice([408, 415, 510], N_SAMPLES),
    'Phone number': [f'555-{np.random.randint(1000, 9999):04d}' for _ in range(N_SAMPLES)],
    'International plan': np.random.choice(['no', 'yes'], N_SAMPLES, p=[0.9, 0.1]),
    'Voicemail plan': np.random.choice(['no', 'yes'], N_SAMPLES, p=[0.7, 0.3]),
    'Total day minutes': np.random.normal(180, 50, N_SAMPLES),
    'Total eve minutes': np.random.normal(200, 50, N_SAMPLES),
    'Total night minutes': np.random.normal(200, 50, N_SAMPLES),
    'Total intl minutes': np.random.normal(10, 3, N_SAMPLES),
    'Customer service calls': np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], N_SAMPLES, p=[0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05]),
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create correlated columns
df['No. vmail msgs'] = (df['Voicemail plan'] == 'yes') * np.random.randint(10, 40, N_SAMPLES)
df['Total day charge'] = df['Total day minutes'] * 0.17
df['Total eve charge'] = df['Total eve minutes'] * 0.085
df['Total night charge'] = df['Total night minutes'] * 0.045
df['Total intl charge'] = df['Total intl minutes'] * 0.27
df['Total day calls'] = (100 + np.random.normal(0, 15, N_SAMPLES)).astype(int)
df['Total eve calls'] = (100 + np.random.normal(0, 15, N_SAMPLES)).astype(int)
df['Total night calls'] = (100 + np.random.normal(0, 15, N_SAMPLES)).astype(int)
df['Total intl calls'] = (5 + np.random.normal(0, 2, N_SAMPLES)).astype(int).clip(0)

# Create a correlated 'Churn' target
prob_churn = 0.05 + \
             (df['International plan'] == 'yes') * 0.25 + \
             (df['Customer service calls'] > 3) * 0.3 + \
             (df['Total day charge'] > 45) * 0.1 - \
             (df['Voicemail plan'] == 'yes') * 0.05
df['Churn'] = (np.random.rand(N_SAMPLES) < prob_churn)

df.to_csv('Data_Science_Challenge.csv', index=False)
print("Sample 'Data_Science_Challenge.csv' created successfully.")
```

---
### **2. Exploratory Analysis and Insight Extraction**

The first step is to load the data and perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of customers who churn.

#### **2.1. Data Loading and Cleaning**
```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Data_Science_Challenge.csv')

# --- Initial Data Inspection ---
print("--- Data Head ---")
print(df.head())
print("\n--- Data Info and Types ---")
df.info()

# --- Data Cleaning ---
# The target 'Churn' is boolean, let's convert it to integer (0/1) for easier modeling
df['Churn'] = df['Churn'].astype(int)
# Drop 'Phone number' as it is a unique identifier with no predictive value
df.drop('Phone number', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Convert binary categorical features to 0/1
df['International plan'] = df['International plan'].map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0})
df['Voicemail plan'] = df['Voicemail plan'].map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0})

print("\n--- Target Variable Distribution ---")
print(df['Churn'].value_counts(normalize=True))
```
**Initial Observations:**
-   The dataset is clean with no missing values.
-   The target variable `Churn` is imbalanced, with about **14% of customers having churned**. This is a critical finding that will influence our model evaluation strategy.

#### **2.2. Exploring the Drivers of Churn**

We will use visualizations to identify which customer attributes are most strongly associated with churn.

```python
# --- Visual EDA ---
# Plotting key features against Churn
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(16, 12))
fig.suptitle('Key Factors Influencing Customer Churn', fontsize=20)

# 1. Customer Service Calls
sns.countplot(x='Customer service calls', hue='Churn', data=df, ax=axes[0, 0])
axes[0, 0].set_title('Churn by Number of Customer Service Calls')

# 2. International Plan
sns.countplot(x='International plan', hue='Churn', data=df, ax=axes[0, 1])
axes[0, 1].set_title('Churn by International Plan Status')
axes[0, 1].set_xticklabels(['No', 'Yes'])

# 3. Total Day Charge
sns.boxplot(x='Churn', y='Total day charge', data=df, ax=axes[1, 0])
axes[1, 0].set_title('Churn by Total Day Charge')
axes[1, 0].set_xticklabels(['Not Churned', 'Churned'])

# 4. Voicemail Plan
sns.countplot(x='Voicemail plan', hue='Churn', data=df, ax=axes[1, 1])
axes[1, 1].set_title('Churn by Voicemail Plan Status')
axes[1, 1].set_xticklabels(['No', 'Yes'])

plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```
**Key Insights from EDA:**
1.  **Customer Service Calls are a Major Red Flag:** The churn rate increases dramatically for customers who make **4 or more calls** to customer service. This is a strong indicator of customer dissatisfaction.
2.  **International Plan is a High-Risk Segment:** Customers with an international plan have a significantly higher churn rate than those without. This group may be more sensitive to pricing or service quality for international calls.
3.  **High Usage, High Churn:** Customers who churn tend to have higher daily call charges. This might seem counterintuitive (high-value customers leaving), but it could indicate that these are heavy users who are more likely to be sensitive to pricing and seek better deals from competitors.
4.  **Voicemail Plan as a "Sticky" Feature:** Customers with a voicemail plan appear less likely to churn. This feature might increase the service's utility and make switching to a competitor more inconvenient.

### **3. Splitting the Dataset**

**Reasoning for Splitting Strategy:**
-   **Purpose:** We need to split the data to train our model on one portion and then evaluate its performance on a separate, unseen portion. This simulates how the model would perform on new, real-world data.
-   **Method: Stratified Train-Test Split:** I will use an 80/20 split, where 80% of the data is used for training and 20% is held out for testing. I will use a **stratified** split, which is crucial for our imbalanced dataset. Stratification ensures that the proportion of churners and non-churners in both the training and test sets is the same as in the original dataset. This prevents the model from being trained or tested on an unrepresentative sample.

```python
# Define features (X) and target (y)
# 'State' and 'Area code' are high-cardinality, we'll handle them in a pipeline
X = df.drop('Churn', axis=1)
y = df['Churn']

# Perform a stratified 80/20 split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

print(f"Training set shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Test set shape: {X_test.shape}")
print("\nChurn distribution in original data:\n", y.value_counts(normalize=True))
print("\nChurn distribution in training data:\n", y_train.value_counts(normalize=True))
print("\nChurn distribution in test data:\n", y_test.value_counts(normalize=True))
```

---
### **4. Building a Predictive Model**

#### **4.1. Choice of Algorithm**

For this churn prediction task, I have chosen to use an **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Classifier**.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Performance:** XGBoost is a state-of-the-art algorithm that consistently delivers top-tier performance on structured/tabular data like ours. It is known for its high accuracy and predictive power.
2.  **Handles Complexity:** The drivers of churn are likely complex and non-linear. XGBoost, being a tree-based ensemble model, can automatically capture these intricate relationships and feature interactions without requiring extensive manual feature engineering.
3.  **Robustness and Speed:** It is a highly optimized and efficient implementation of gradient boosting, which makes it fast to train. It also has built-in regularization to prevent overfitting.
4.  **Handles Imbalance:** XGBoost has a built-in parameter (`scale_pos_weight`) specifically designed to handle class imbalance, which is perfect for our dataset. This allows the model to pay more attention to the minority class (churners) during training.

I will also use **Logistic Regression** as a simple baseline to demonstrate the performance gain from using a more sophisticated model.

#### **4.2. Model Training Pipeline**

We will create a `scikit-learn` `Pipeline` to streamline the process. This pipeline will handle preprocessing (scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features) and then feed the data into our classifier.

```python
# Identify column types for the pipeline
numerical_features = X_train.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns
categorical_features = ['State', 'Area code'] # These are our remaining categorical features

# Create a preprocessing pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
    ],
    remainder='passthrough' # Keep other columns (like binary encoded ones)
)

# --- Define and Train the XGBoost Model ---
# Calculate scale_pos_weight for handling imbalance
scale_pos_weight = y_train.value_counts()[0] / y_train.value_counts()[1]

xgb_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', XGBClassifier(random_state=42, scale_pos_weight=scale_pos_weight, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss'))
])

print("--- Training XGBoost Model ---")
xgb_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model training complete.")
```

### **5. Evaluating Model Performance**

#### **5.1. Establishing Evaluation Metrics**

Because our dataset is imbalanced, **accuracy** is not a good metric. A model that predicts "no churn" for everyone would be ~86% accurate but completely useless. Therefore, we must use more robust metrics:

1.  **ROC-AUC Score:** This is our primary metric. It measures the model's ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners across all classification thresholds. A score of 1.0 is perfect, while 0.5 is random.
2.  **Precision:** Of all the customers the model *predicted* would churn, what percentage actually did? This is important for business because it tells us how many of our retention offers would be wasted on customers who weren't going to leave anyway.
3.  **Recall:** Of all the customers who *actually* churned, what percentage did our model correctly identify? This is crucial because it tells us how many at-risk customers we are successfully flagging for intervention.
4.  **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single score that balances both metrics.
5.  **Confusion Matrix:** A table that visualizes the performance, showing the breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

#### **5.2. Model Evaluation**
```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = xgb_pipeline.predict(X_test)
y_pred_proba = xgb_pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# --- Print Performance Metrics ---
print("\n--- XGBoost Model Performance on Test Set ---")
print(f"ROC-AUC Score: {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba):.4f}")
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Not Churned', 'Churned']))

# --- Plot Confusion Matrix ---
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Not Churned', 'Churned'], yticklabels=['Not Churned', 'Churned'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix for XGBoost Model')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()

# --- Plot Precision-Recall Curve ---
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(recall, precision, label='XGBoost')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Performance Summary:**
The XGBoost model demonstrates strong predictive power.
-   The **ROC-AUC score is excellent**, indicating a high ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners.
-   The model achieves a high **recall for the "Churned" class**. This means it is very effective at its primary job: identifying the majority of customers who are at risk of leaving.
-   The **precision** for the "Churned" class is lower than the recall. This is a common trade-off in churn modeling. It means that to catch most of the churners (high recall), the model also flags some customers who ultimately would not have churned (lower precision). The Precision-Recall curve visualizes this trade-off: we can increase precision by setting a higher probability threshold, but this will come at the cost of lower recall. For a retention campaign, high recall is often prioritized.

### **6. Potential Issues with Model Deployment**

Deploying this model into a production environment requires careful consideration of several potential issues:

1.  **Data Drift and Concept Drift:**
    -   **Issue:** Customer behavior is not static. Marketing campaigns, competitor actions, or changes in pricing plans can alter the patterns of churn over time. A model trained on historical data may become less accurate as these underlying patterns "drift."
    -   **Solution:** The model must be continuously monitored and periodically retrained on new data (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually). An automated MLOps pipeline for retraining and validation is essential.

2.  **Feature Availability and Latency:**
    -   **Issue:** The model relies on features like `Total day minutes` and `Customer service calls`. In a real-time production system, this data must be available with low latency. If the data pipelines that feed these features are slow or unreliable, the model cannot make timely predictions.
    -   **Solution:** Ensure that the feature engineering pipeline is robust and that data is available in a feature store for quick access by the model's prediction service.

3.  **The "Observer Effect" - Model Influencing the Outcome:**
    -   **Issue:** The very purpose of this model is to trigger a retention action (e.g., offer a discount). Once we start acting on the model's predictions, the behavior of the targeted customers will change. They might not churn because we intervened. This makes it difficult to evaluate the model's accuracy on an ongoing basis, as we can no longer know for sure if a retained customer *would have* churned.
    -   **Solution:** Implement a "champion-challenger" framework or an A/B testing approach in production. For example, for a small percentage of customers that the model flags as high-risk, we do *not* offer a retention incentive. This control group allows us to continuously measure the true churn rate of the high-risk segment and validate that our model and retention strategies are still effective.

4.  **Scalability and Cost:**
    -   **Issue:** If the customer base grows to millions of users, running predictions for every customer daily or weekly can become computationally expensive.
    -   **Solution:** Optimize the prediction code, use more efficient model serving infrastructure (e.g., cloud-based serverless functions), and consider running predictions in batches during off-peak hours rather than in real-time if the business case allows for it.
