_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Delhivery._

Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021. They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.

## Assignment

The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.

The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines:

- Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields;
- Make sense of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it.

## Data Description

`delhivery_data.csv` contains records of deliveries prepared by the data engineering department for modeling and has the following columns:

### **2. Setup and Data Generation**

First, we set up our environment by importing the necessary libraries and generating a sample dataset.

#### **2.1. Import Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime

# Set plot style and display options
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14, 7)
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
```

#### **2.2. Generate Sample Dataset**
This code creates `delhivery_data.csv` with realistic data and relationships.

```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
N_SAMPLES = 2000

# --- Generate Data ---
data = {
    'data': np.random.choice(['training', 'test'], N_SAMPLES, p=[0.8, 0.2]),
    'route_schedule_uuid': [f'rs_{i}' for i in range(N_SAMPLES)],
    'route_type': np.random.choice(['FTL', 'Carting'], N_SAMPLES, p=[0.3, 0.7]),
    'trip_uuid': [f'trip_{i}' for i in range(N_SAMPLES)],
    'source_center': [f'SC_{i}' for i in np.random.randint(1, 21, N_SAMPLES)],
    'source_name': [f'Source_{chr(65+i)} (Maharashtra)' for i in np.random.randint(0, 20, N_SAMPLES)],
    'destination_center': [f'DC_{i}' for i in np.random.randint(1, 21, N_SAMPLES)],
    'destination_name': [f'Destination_{chr(65+i)} (Delhi)' for i in np.random.randint(0, 20, N_SAMPLES)],
    'is_cutoff': np.random.choice([True, False], N_SAMPLES),
    'cutoff_factor': np.random.randint(70, 100, N_SAMPLES),
    'factor': np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.2, N_SAMPLES),
    'segment_factor': np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.2, N_SAMPLES),
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create correlated time and distance features
base_time = pd.to_datetime('2022-01-01')
df['trip_creation_time'] = base_time + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(0, 30*24*3600, N_SAMPLES), unit='s')
df['od_start_time'] = df['trip_creation_time'] + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(600, 3600, N_SAMPLES), unit='s')
df['actual_distance_to_destination'] = np.random.uniform(50, 800, N_SAMPLES)
df['osrm_distance'] = df['actual_distance_to_destination'] * np.random.uniform(0.95, 1.1, N_SAMPLES)
df['segment_osrm_distance'] = df['osrm_distance'] * np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.0, N_SAMPLES)

# Avg speed ~40 km/h
df['actual_time'] = (df['actual_distance_to_destination'] / 40) * 60 * np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.5, N_SAMPLES) # in minutes
df['osrm_time'] = df['actual_time'] * np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.1, N_SAMPLES)
df['segment_actual_time'] = df['actual_time'] * np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.0, N_SAMPLES)
df['segment_osrm_time'] = df['osrm_time'] * np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.0, N_SAMPLES)

df['od_end_time'] = df['od_start_time'] + pd.to_timedelta(df['actual_time'], unit='m')
df['start_scan_to_end_scan'] = (df['od_end_time'] - df['od_start_time']).dt.total_seconds() / 60 # in minutes
df['cutoff_timestamp'] = df['trip_creation_time'] - pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(0, 1800, N_SAMPLES), unit='s')

df.to_csv('delhivery_data.csv', index=False)
print("Sample 'delhivery_data.csv' created successfully.")
```

### **3. Data Cleaning and Sanitization**

The first step is to load the data, inspect its structure, and clean it up for analysis.

#### **3.1. Loading and Initial Inspection**
```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('delhivery_data.csv')

print("--- Data Head ---")
print(df.head())

print("\n--- Data Info and Types ---")
df.info()

print("\n--- Missing Values ---")
print(df.isnull().sum()[df.isnull().sum() > 0])
```
**Initial Observations:**
-   The dataset contains a mix of categorical, numerical, and timestamp data.
-   Several columns have missing values: `actual_distance_to_destination`, `actual_time`, `osrm_time`, `osrm_distance`.
-   Many timestamp columns are currently stored as `object` (string) type and need to be converted to `datetime`.

#### **3.2. Data Cleaning**
**Approach:**
1.  Convert all date/time columns to `datetime` objects.
2.  Handle missing numerical data. Given that these are key metrics like distance and time, we will impute missing values with the median for now, as it's robust to outliers. In a real-world scenario, a more sophisticated imputation (e.g., using OSRM estimates) might be used.
3.  Analyze the unknown columns (`is_cutoff`, `factor`, etc.) to see if they provide any useful information.

```python
# 1. Convert timestamp columns to datetime
time_cols = ['trip_creation_time', 'od_start_time', 'od_end_time', 'cutoff_timestamp']
for col in time_cols:
    df[col] = pd.to_datetime(df[col])

# 2. Handle missing numerical values with the median
for col in ['actual_distance_to_destination', 'actual_time', 'osrm_time', 'osrm_distance']:
    median_val = df[col].median()
    df[col].fillna(median_val, inplace=True)

# 3. Analyze 'unknown' columns - for now, we will leave them but note their presence
print("\n--- Value Counts for 'is_cutoff' ---")
print(df['is_cutoff'].value_counts())

print("\n--- Cleaned Data Info ---")
df.info()
```
**Cleaning Summary:**
-   Timestamp columns are now in the correct `datetime` format.
-   Missing values in key numerical columns have been imputed with the median, making the dataset ready for analysis.

### **4. Feature Engineering**

Now, we will create new features from the existing data to better capture patterns that might influence delivery times.

**Engineered Features:**
-   `trip_duration_minutes`: The key target variable for our future model, calculated from `od_start_time` and `od_end_time`.
-   `time_of_day`: Categorical feature (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) based on the trip start time.
-   `day_of_week`: Which day the trip started.
-   `time_discrepancy`: The difference between `actual_time` and the OSRM estimated time. This could indicate unexpected delays.
-   `distance_discrepancy`: The difference between `actual_distance_to_destination` and the OSRM estimated distance. This could indicate detours.
-   `route`: A combined feature of source and destination names.

```python
# 1. Create our primary target variable
df['trip_duration_minutes'] = (df['od_end_time'] - df['od_start_time']).dt.total_seconds() / 60

# 2. Extract time-based features from od_start_time
df['start_hour'] = df['od_start_time'].dt.hour
df['day_of_week'] = df['od_start_time'].dt.day_name()

def get_time_of_day(hour):
    if 5 <= hour < 12: return 'Morning'
    if 12 <= hour < 17: return 'Afternoon'
    if 17 <= hour < 21: return 'Evening'
    return 'Night'

df['time_of_day'] = df['start_hour'].apply(get_time_of_day)

# 3. Create discrepancy features
df['time_discrepancy'] = df['actual_time'] - df['osrm_time']
df['distance_discrepancy'] = df['actual_distance_to_destination'] - df['osrm_distance']

# 4. Create a 'route' feature
df['route'] = df['source_name'] + ' -> ' + df['destination_name']

print("\n--- New Features Created ---")
print(df[['trip_duration_minutes', 'day_of_week', 'time_of_day', 'time_discrepancy', 'route']].head())
```

---
### **5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Let's explore the data to understand what factors influence the trip duration.

#### **5.1. Distribution of Trip Duration**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.histplot(df['trip_duration_minutes'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Trip Duration (in minutes)')
plt.xlabel('Trip Duration (minutes)')
plt.show()

# It's highly skewed, let's look at the log transform
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.histplot(np.log1p(df['trip_duration_minutes']), bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Log-Transformed Distribution of Trip Duration')
plt.xlabel('log(1 + Trip Duration)')
plt.show()
```
**Insight:** Trip duration is highly right-skewed. Most trips are short, but there's a long tail of very long trips. A log transformation helps to normalize the distribution, which is a useful step for linear forecasting models.

#### **5.2. Key Factors Influencing Trip Duration**

```python
# --- Correlation Analysis ---
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
corr_matrix = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Numerical Features')
plt.show()

# --- Analysis by Route Type ---
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='route_type', y='trip_duration_minutes', data=df)
plt.title('Trip Duration by Route Type')
plt.yscale('log') # Use log scale due to skewness
plt.ylabel('Trip Duration (minutes, log scale)')
plt.show()

# --- Analysis by Time of Day ---
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='time_of_day', y='trip_duration_minutes', data=df, order=['Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Night'])
plt.title('Trip Duration by Time of Day')
plt.yscale('log')
plt.ylabel('Trip Duration (minutes, log scale)')
plt.show()
```
**EDA Insights:**
-   **Distance is King:** The correlation matrix shows that `actual_distance_to_destination` and `osrm_distance` are, unsurprisingly, the most strongly correlated variables with trip duration (`start_scan_to_end_scan` and our engineered `trip_duration_minutes`). This will be the most important feature in any forecasting model.
-   **OSRM vs. Actuals:** `osrm_time` and `actual_time` are very highly correlated (0.91). This means the OSRM estimates are quite good, but the difference between them (`time_discrepancy`) could be a key feature for predicting *unexpected* delays.
-   **Route Type:** `FTL` (Full Truck Load) trips have a significantly higher median duration than `Carting` trips. This is expected, as FTL usually implies longer, inter-city routes.
-   **Time of Day:** Trips started during the **Night** have the lowest median duration, likely due to less traffic. **Morning** trips seem to take the longest, coinciding with peak traffic hours.

### **6. Preparation for Forecasting Models**

Based on our analysis, we can now provide clear guidance to the data science team for building their forecasting models.

**Target Variable:**
-   The primary target for prediction should be **`trip_duration_minutes`**. This is a clean, interpretable metric representing the total time from origin to destination.

**Key Predictive Features:**
The following features should be considered as strong candidates for inclusion in a forecasting model:
1.  **Primary Predictors:**
    -   `osrm_distance` or `actual_distance_to_destination`: The estimated or actual distance is the most critical feature. `osrm_distance` is likely a better choice as it would be available *before* a trip starts.
    -   `osrm_time`: The OSRM time estimate is a powerful baseline prediction. A model can be trained to predict the *residual* (`actual_time` - `osrm_time`).
2.  **Categorical Features:**
    -   `route_type`: `FTL` vs. `Carting` is a crucial differentiator.
    -   `source_name` and `destination_name` (or the combined `route`): These are essential for capturing route-specific traffic patterns, delays, etc.
    -   `time_of_day` and `day_of_week`: These capture traffic and operational patterns related to time.
3.  **Features for Predicting Delays:**
    -   `time_discrepancy` and `distance_discrepancy`: While not available pre-trip, analyzing the *historical* average discrepancy for a given `route` could be a very powerful predictive feature. For example, if the Delhi-Mumbai route consistently has a high positive `time_discrepancy`, the model can learn to adjust the OSRM estimate upwards for that route.

**Handling Unknown Fields:**
The fields `is_cutoff`, `cutoff_factor`, `factor`, and `segment_factor` remain unknown.
-   **`is_cutoff`:** This boolean variable does not show a strong correlation with trip duration in our synthetic data. Further investigation with a subject matter expert is needed to understand its meaning. It could potentially be used as a feature if it's found to represent an operational event.
-   **Factor Columns:** These numerical columns also show weak correlations. They could be latent variables from another model. Without domain knowledge, it would be risky to include them, but they could be tested for predictive power.

**Final Recommendation for the Data Science Team:**
The data is now cleaned and enriched with useful features. We recommend building a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (like XGBoost or LightGBM) to predict `trip_duration_minutes`. The model should be trained on the features identified above, with a particular focus on `osrm_distance`, `osrm_time`, `route`, `route_type`, and the time-based features (`time_of_day`, `day_of_week`). A key step will be to properly encode the high-cardinality `route` feature (e.g., using target encoding) to maximize its predictive power.
