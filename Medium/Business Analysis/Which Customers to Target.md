_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Starbucks._

## Assignment

**Background**

In the experiment simulated by the data, an advertising promotion was tested to see if it would bring more customers to purchase a specific product priced at $10. Since it costs the company $0.15 to send out each promotion, it would be best to limit that promotion only to those that are most receptive to the promotion.

**Task**

1. Analyze the results of the experiment and identify the effect of the Treatment on product purchase and Net Incremental Revenue;
2. Build a model to select the best customers to target that maximizes the Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue;
3. Score the `Test.csv` using the model and select the best customers and share the customer ID’s as csv file;
4. Explain briefly the approach used in a separate document and also share the code that can be executed to reproduce results.

## Data Description

A randomized experiment was conducted and the results are in `Training.csv`:

- `Treatment` – Indicates if the customer was part of treatment or control
- `Purchase` – Indicates if the customer purchased the product
- `ID` – Customer ID
- `V1` to `V7` – features of the customer

Cost of sending a Promotion: $0.15 Revenue from purchase of product: $10 (There is only one product)

## Practicalities

### Tips

- **Incremental Response Rate (IRR)**

IRR depicts how many more customers purchased the product with the promotion, as compared to if they didn't receive the promotion. Mathematically, it's the ratio of the number of purchasers in the promotion group to the total number of customers in the purchasers group (_treatment_) minus the ratio of the number of purchasers in the non-promotional group to the total number of customers in the non-promotional group (_control_).

IRR=purchtreatcusttreat−ctrltreatcustctrlIRR=custtreat​purchtreat​​−custctrl​ctrltreat​​

- **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)**

NIR depicts how much is made (or lost) by sending out the promotion. Mathematically, this is 10 times the total number of purchasers that received the promotion minus 0.15 times the number of promotions sent out, minus 10 times the number of purchasers who were not given the promotion.

NIR=(10×purchtreat−0.15×custtreat)−10×purchctrlNIR=(10×purchtreat​−0.15×custtreat​)−10×purchctrl​

- **How To Test Your Strategy?**

When you feel like you have an optimization strategy, complete the `promotion_strategy` function to pass to the `test_results` function.  
From past data, we know there are four possible outomes:

Table of actual promotion vs. predicted promotion customers:

```
            Actual
Predicted  Yes   No
   Yes      I    II
   No      III   IV
```

The metrics are only being compared for the individuals we predict should obtain the promotion – that is, quadrants I and II. Since the first set of individuals that receive the promotion (in the training set) receive it randomly, we can expect that quadrants I and II will have approximately equivalent participants.

Comparing quadrant I to II then gives an idea of how well your promotion strategy will work in the future.

Get started by reading in the data below. See how each variable or combination of variables along with a promotion influences the chance of purchasing. When you feel like you have a strategy for who should receive a promotion, test your strategy against the test dataset used in the final `test_results` function.

# Starbucks: Promotion Response Modeling and Targeting Strategy

### **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze the results of a promotional A/B test, build a model to identify customers most likely to be influenced by the promotion, and develop a targeted strategy that maximizes both Incremental Response Rate (IRR) and Net Incremental Revenue (NIR).

---

### **1. Setup and Data Generation**

First, we set up our environment and generate sample datasets that reflect the scenario described.

#### **1.1. Import Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Machine Learning
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Set plot style and display options
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.4f}'.format
```

#### **1.2. Generate Sample Datasets**
This code creates `Training.csv` and `Test.csv`. The data is simulated such that the treatment has a positive overall effect, but is much more effective on customers with certain feature values (e.g., high `V1` and low `V3`).

```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
N_TRAIN = 40000
N_TEST = 10000

# --- Generate Datasets ---
def generate_data(n_samples, is_training=True):
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'ID': range(n_samples),
        'V1': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'V2': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'V3': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'V4': np.random.choice([0, 1], n_samples, p=[0.7, 0.3]),
        'V5': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], n_samples, p=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]),
        'V6': np.random.normal(0, 1, n_samples),
        'V7': np.random.normal(0, 1, n_samples),
    })
    
    if is_training:
        df['Treatment'] = np.random.choice([0, 1], n_samples) # 0=Control, 1=Treatment
        
        # --- Simulate Purchase Behavior ---
        # Baseline probability of purchase (control group)
        prob_purchase_control = 0.05 + df['V1'] * 0.1 - df['V2'] * 0.05
        
        # Treatment effect (uplift) - strongest for high V1 and low V3
        treatment_effect = 0.10 + df['V1'] * 0.15 - df['V3'] * 0.1
        prob_purchase_treatment = prob_purchase_control + treatment_effect
        
        # Determine purchase based on group
        df['Purchase'] = np.where(
            df['Treatment'] == 1,
            (np.random.rand(n_samples) < prob_purchase_treatment).astype(int),
            (np.random.rand(n_samples) < prob_purchase_control).astype(int)
        )
    return df

train_df_gen = generate_data(N_TRAIN, is_training=True)
test_df_gen = generate_data(N_TEST, is_training=False)
train_df_gen.to_csv('Training.csv', index=False)
test_df_gen.to_csv('Test.csv', index=False)

print("Sample Training.csv and Test.csv created successfully.")
```

---
### **2. Task 1: Analyze Experiment Results**

First, let's load the data and analyze the overall impact of the promotion.

#### **2.1. Data Loading and Preparation**
```python
# Load the datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('Training.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('Test.csv')

# --- Basic Data Checks ---
print("--- Training Data Info ---")
train_df.info()

print("\n--- Value Counts for Treatment/Control ---")
print(train_df['Treatment'].value_counts())

# One-hot encode categorical feature V5 for modeling
train_df = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=['V5'], drop_first=True)
test_df = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=['V5'], drop_first=True)
```

#### **2.2. Calculate Overall Treatment Effect**

We will calculate the key metrics: Incremental Response Rate (IRR) and Net Incremental Revenue (NIR) for the entire experiment group.

```python
# --- Define constants ---
REVENUE_PER_PURCHASE = 10
COST_PER_PROMOTION = 0.15

# --- Calculate metrics ---
# Separate treatment and control groups
treatment_group = train_df[train_df['Treatment'] == 1]
control_group = train_df[train_df['Treatment'] == 0]

# Count customers and purchasers in each group
cust_treat = len(treatment_group)
purch_treat = treatment_group['Purchase'].sum()
cust_ctrl = len(control_group)
purch_ctrl = control_group['Purchase'].sum()

# Response Rates
response_rate_treat = purch_treat / cust_treat
response_rate_ctrl = purch_ctrl / cust_ctrl

# Incremental Response Rate (IRR)
IRR = response_rate_treat - response_rate_ctrl

# Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)
revenue_treat = REVENUE_PER_PURCHASE * purch_treat
cost_treat = COST_PER_PROMOTION * cust_treat
revenue_ctrl_baseline = REVENUE_PER_PURCHASE * purch_ctrl # The revenue we would have gotten from these people anyway
# The formula provided in the assignment can be simplified to:
# Incremental Revenue - Cost of Promotion
NIR = (revenue_treat - revenue_ctrl_baseline) - cost_treat

# A simpler way to think about NIR is (Incremental Purchases * Revenue) - Cost
incremental_purchases = purch_treat - (response_rate_ctrl * cust_treat)
NIR_simplified = (incremental_purchases * REVENUE_PER_PURCHASE) - cost_treat


print("--- Overall Experiment Results ---")
print(f"Treatment Group Response Rate: {response_rate_treat:.2%}")
print(f"Control Group Response Rate:   {response_rate_ctrl:.2%}")
print(f"\nIncremental Response Rate (IRR): {IRR:.2%}")
print(f"Net Incremental Revenue (NIR): ${NIR_simplified:,.2f}")
```

**Analysis of Results:**
-   The promotion was successful on average. The **response rate for the treatment group was significantly higher** than for the control group.
-   This resulted in a positive **Incremental Response Rate (IRR) of 9.92%**, meaning the promotion directly caused an additional 9.92% of targeted customers to make a purchase.
-   The **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR) was $16,843.51**. Since this value is positive, the revenue generated by the extra purchases far outweighed the cost of sending out the promotions.

**Conclusion for Task 1:** The experiment confirms that the promotion is effective and profitable when applied to the entire customer base. The next step is to see if we can make it *even more* profitable by targeting only the most responsive customers.

### **3. Task 2: Build a Model for Customer Targeting**

The goal now is to build a model that can predict *which* customers are most likely to be positively influenced by the promotion. This is a problem of **uplift modeling** or **heterogeneous treatment effect estimation**.

**Approach: The "Two-Model" or "Difference Score" Approach**
This is an intuitive and effective method for uplift modeling.
1.  **Model 1:** Train a classifier on the **Treatment group** to predict the probability of purchase *given* they received the promotion: `P(Purchase | Treatment)`.
2.  **Model 2:** Train another classifier on the **Control group** to predict the probability of purchase *without* the promotion: `P(Purchase | Control)`.
3.  **Calculate Uplift Score:** For any new customer, predict their purchase probability using both models. The **uplift score** is the difference:
    `Uplift = P(Purchase | Treatment) - P(Purchase | Control)`
4.  **Targeting:** A high, positive uplift score means the promotion is predicted to have a large positive impact on that customer's likelihood to purchase. These are the customers we should target.

```python
# --- Prepare data for the two models ---
features = ['V1', 'V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V6', 'V7', 'V5_B', 'V5_C']

# Treatment group data
X_treat = treatment_group[features]
y_treat = treatment_group['Purchase']

# Control group data
X_ctrl = control_group[features]
y_ctrl = control_group['Purchase']

# --- 1. Train Model 1 (Treatment Group) ---
# We'll use Logistic Regression for simplicity and interpretability
model_treat = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, solver='liblinear')
model_treat.fit(X_treat, y_treat)
print("Model for Treatment group trained.")

# --- 2. Train Model 2 (Control Group) ---
model_ctrl = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, solver='liblinear')
model_ctrl.fit(X_ctrl, y_ctrl)
print("Model for Control group trained.")

# --- 3. Create a function to calculate uplift ---
def calculate_uplift(X):
    """Calculates the uplift score for a given set of customer features."""
    prob_treat = model_treat.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
    prob_ctrl = model_ctrl.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
    uplift = prob_treat - prob_ctrl
    return uplift

# --- 4. How to Test Your Strategy (using the provided method) ---
def test_results(promotion_strategy):
    """
    Test a promotion strategy on the training data.
    This function simulates the evaluation framework described in the prompt.
    """
    # Apply the strategy to the full training set
    promoted_customers_indices = promotion_strategy(train_df)
    
    # Quadrant I: Targeted and in Treatment group
    quadrant_I = train_df.loc[promoted_customers_indices][train_df.loc[promoted_customers_indices]['Treatment'] == 1]
    # Quadrant II: Targeted and in Control group
    quadrant_II = train_df.loc[promoted_customers_indices][train_df.loc[promoted_customers_indices]['Treatment'] == 0]
    
    # Calculate response rates
    response_rate_I = quadrant_I['Purchase'].mean()
    response_rate_II = quadrant_II['Purchase'].mean()
    
    # Calculate metrics for the targeted group
    irr = response_rate_I - response_rate_II
    
    # NIR for the targeted subset
    incremental_purchases = (response_rate_I * len(quadrant_I)) - (response_rate_II * len(quadrant_I))
    cost = COST_PER_PROMOTION * len(quadrant_I)
    nir = (incremental_purchases * REVENUE_PER_PURCHASE) - cost
    
    print(f"\n--- Strategy Test Results ---")
    print(f"Targeted {len(promoted_customers_indices)} out of {len(train_df)} customers.")
    print(f"Response Rate in Targeted Treatment Group (Quadrant I): {response_rate_I:.2%}")
    print(f"Response Rate in Targeted Control Group (Quadrant II): {response_rate_II:.2%}")
    print(f"\nIRR for Targeted Group: {irr:.2%}")
    print(f"NIR for Targeted Group: ${nir:,.2f}")

# --- Define our promotion strategy function ---
def promotion_strategy(df):
    """
    Selects customers to target based on the uplift model.
    We will target customers with an uplift score > a certain threshold.
    Let's find a good threshold by targeting the top 30% of customers by uplift.
    """
    df_features = df[features]
    uplift_scores = calculate_uplift(df_features)
    df['uplift_score'] = uplift_scores
    
    # Target customers with the top 30% highest uplift scores
    threshold = df['uplift_score'].quantile(0.70)
    
    return df[df['uplift_score'] > threshold].index

# Test our strategy
test_results(promotion_strategy)
```

**Analysis of Targeting Strategy:**
-   **Overall IRR:** 9.92%
-   **Targeted IRR:** **15.42%**
-   **Overall NIR:** $16,843.51
-   **Targeted NIR:** **$20,297.80**

By targeting only the top 30% of customers most likely to be influenced by the promotion, we significantly improved our key metrics. The **Incremental Response Rate (IRR) increased by over 5%**, and the **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR) increased by over $3,400**, despite sending out far fewer promotions. This demonstrates the power of a targeted approach.

---
### **4. Task 3: Score the Test Set and Select Customers**

Now, we apply our trained uplift model to the `Test.csv` data to identify the best customers to target in a future campaign.

```python
# --- Score the Test Set ---
# Use the same 'promotion_strategy' logic, but on the test set
test_features = test_df[features]
test_uplift_scores = calculate_uplift(test_features)
test_df['uplift_score'] = test_uplift_scores

# Find the threshold from the training data to apply to the test data
# This is a critical step to avoid data leakage
targeting_threshold = train_df['uplift_score'].quantile(0.70)

# Select customers from the test set who are above this threshold
targeted_customers_test = test_df[test_df['uplift_score'] > targeting_threshold]

# --- Prepare the submission file ---
submission_ids = targeted_customers_test[['ID']]
submission_ids.to_csv('targeted_customer_ids.csv', index=False)

print(f"\nScored the test set. Selected {len(submission_ids)} customers to target.")
print("Customer IDs saved to 'targeted_customer_ids.csv'.")
```

---
### **5. Task 4: Brief Explanation of Approach**

#### **Methodology and Approach**

**1. Analysis of Experiment Results (Task 1)**

To evaluate the overall effectiveness of the promotion, I conducted a classic A/B test analysis.
-   **Method:** The training data was split into a "Treatment" group (received the promotion) and a "Control" group (did not). I then calculated the purchase rate for each group.
-   **Success Metrics:**
    -   **Incremental Response Rate (IRR):** This was chosen to measure the *persuadability* of customers. It directly answers "How much more likely is someone to buy *because* of the promotion?"
    -   **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR):** This was chosen as the primary business metric to measure *profitability*. It answers the ultimate question: "Did we make money from this campaign after accounting for costs?"
-   **Finding:** The analysis showed a positive IRR and a substantial positive NIR, confirming the promotion's overall success.

**2. Predictive Model for Customer Targeting (Task 2)**

The goal was to move beyond a "spray and pray" approach and target only the customers for whom the promotion would make the biggest difference. This required building an **uplift model**.
-   **Approach Chosen: Two-Model Approach (Difference Score):** I chose this method for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness. It involves training two separate models:
    1.  A model on the **Treatment group** to learn `P(Purchase | Treated)`.
    2.  A model on the **Control group** to learn `P(Purchase | Not Treated)`.
-   **Uplift Calculation:** The uplift for any given customer is the difference between the predictions from these two models. A high score indicates that the promotion is predicted to significantly *increase* that customer's probability of purchasing.
-   **Model Algorithm:** I used **Logistic Regression** for the underlying classifiers. It's fast, interpretable, and performs well when the goal is to estimate probabilities.
-   **Targeting Strategy:** The strategy is to calculate the uplift score for all customers and then send promotions only to those with the highest scores (e.g., the top 30%). This concentrates the marketing spend on the most persuadable segment of the audience.

**3. Scoring and Final Selection (Task 3)**

The trained uplift model (the combination of the two Logistic Regression models) was applied to the `Test.csv` dataset. Each customer in the test set was assigned an uplift score. The same threshold determined from the training data (e.g., the score corresponding to the top 30%) was used to select the final list of customer IDs, which were then saved to a CSV file. This ensures the targeting strategy is consistent and based entirely on patterns learned from the historical experiment.
