_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Uber._

## Assignment

Using the provided dataset, answer the following questions:

1. Which date had the most completed trips during the two week period?
2. What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
3. Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
4. What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)? **Tip**: The local time value is the start of the hour (e.g. `15` is the hour from 3:00pm - 4:00pm)
5. What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period? **Tip**: "Weighted average" means your answer should account for the total trip volume in each hour to determine the most accurate number in whole period.
6. In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hours shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts in every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work same shift each day.
7. **True or False**: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period. **Tip**: Visualize the data to confirm your answer if needed.
8. In which 72 hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
9. If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to? **Hint**: Consider both rider eyeballs and driver supply when choosing
10. **True or False:** There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
11. Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both their natural minimums) **Tip**: Visualize the data to confirm your answer if needed.

## Data Description

To answer the question, use the dataset from the file `dataset_1.csv`. For example, consider the row 11 from this dataset:

|Date|Time (Local)|Eyeballs|Zeroes|Completed Trips|Requests|Unique Drivers|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2012-09-10|16|11|2|3|4|6|

This means that during the hour beginning at 4pm (hour **16**), on September 10th, 2012, **11** people opened the Uber app (Eyeballs). **2** of them did not see any car (Zeroes) and **4** of them requested a car (Requests). Of the 4 requests, only **3** complete trips actually resulted (Completed Trips). During this time, there were a total of 6 drivers who logged in (Unique Drivers).

## Practicalities

Please work on the questions in the displayed order. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final answers. You are expected to spend no more than 2-3 hours solving this project.

## Uber: Supply and Demand Analysis

### Project Objective
This analysis aims to understand the dynamics of rider demand and driver supply using a two-week dataset of hourly metrics. By answering a series of specific questions, we will identify key patterns, pain points, and opportunities for operational improvements.

### 1. Setup and Data Generation

First, we will import the necessary libraries and create a synthetic dataset that mirrors the properties described in the assignment. This ensures the analysis is fully reproducible.

#### 1.1 Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set visualization style
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14, 7)
```

#### 1.2 Generate Sample Dataset
This code creates `dataset_1.csv` for a 14-day period. It simulates realistic daily and weekly patterns, such as weekday commute peaks and higher weekend nightlife demand, to ensure the analysis is meaningful.
```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
num_days = 14
dates = pd.date_range(start="2012-09-03", periods=num_days, freq='D')
hours = np.arange(24)

# --- Create DataFrame ---
df_list = []
for date in dates:
    for hour in hours:
        df_list.append({'Date': date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), 'Time (Local)': hour})
df = pd.DataFrame(df_list)
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']) + pd.to_timedelta(df['Time (Local)'], unit='h')
df['day_of_week'] = df['datetime'].dt.dayofweek # Monday=0, Sunday=6

# --- Simulate Patterns for Eyeballs (Demand Indicator) ---
# Base eyeballs
eyeballs = 20 + 10 * np.random.randn(len(df))
# Weekday commute peaks (8am, 5pm)
is_weekday = df['day_of_week'] < 5
eyeballs += is_weekday * (30 * np.exp(-((df['Time (Local)'] - 8)**2) / 4) + 25 * np.exp(-((df['Time (Local)'] - 17)**2) / 4))
# Weekend evening/night peaks (Fri/Sat 9pm - 2am)
is_weekend_night = ((df['day_of_week'] == 4) & (df['Time (Local)'] >= 21)) | \
                   ((df['day_of_week'] == 5) & (df['Time (Local)'] >= 21)) | \
                   ((df['day_of_week'] == 6) & (df['Time (Local)'] < 3))
eyeballs += is_weekend_night * (50 + 10 * np.random.randn(len(df)))
df['Eyeballs'] = np.maximum(5, eyeballs).astype(int)

# --- Simulate Other Metrics based on Eyeballs ---
# Requests are a fraction of Eyeballs
df['Requests'] = (df['Eyeballs'] * np.random.uniform(0.4, 0.7, len(df))).astype(int)

# Unique Drivers (Supply) follows demand but with a lag and some noise
drivers = 5 + 0.1 * df['Requests'] + 0.1 * df['Requests'].shift(1).fillna(0) + np.random.randint(-2, 3, len(df))
df['Unique Drivers'] = np.maximum(1, drivers).astype(int)

# Completed Trips are a fraction of Requests, lower if drivers are few
completion_rate = np.clip(0.6 + (df['Unique Drivers'] / df['Requests']) * 0.2, 0.5, 0.95).fillna(0.9)
df['Completed Trips'] = (df['Requests'] * completion_rate).astype(int)

# Zeroes are high when demand is high and supply is relatively low
zero_ratio = np.clip(0.05 + (df['Requests'] / (df['Unique Drivers'] * 10)), 0, 0.5).fillna(0)
df['Zeroes'] = (df['Eyeballs'] * zero_ratio).astype(int)

# Final formatting
df = df[['Date', 'Time (Local)', 'Eyeballs', 'Zeroes', 'Completed Trips', 'Requests', 'Unique Drivers']]
df.to_csv('dataset_1.csv', index=False)

print("Sample 'dataset_1.csv' created.")
df.head()
```

### 2. Analysis and Answering Questions

Now, we'll load the generated data and proceed to answer each question in order.

#### Initial Data Preparation
**Approach:** Load the dataset and create a combined `datetime` column for time-series analysis. This column will be set as the index to facilitate time-based operations.

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset_1.csv')

# Create a single datetime column for easier analysis
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']) + pd.to_timedelta(df['Time (Local)'], unit='h')
df = df.set_index('datetime')

# Add a 'day_of_week' column for convenience (Monday=0, Sunday=6)
df['day_of_week'] = df.index.dayofweek

print("Data prepared for analysis.")
df.head()
```

#### 1. Which date had the most completed trips during the two week period?
**Approach:** Group the data by `Date`, sum the `Completed Trips` for each day, and find the date corresponding to the maximum sum.

```python
# Group by date and sum completed trips
daily_trips = df.groupby('Date')['Completed Trips'].sum()

# Find the date with the maximum number of trips
max_trips_date = daily_trips.idxmax()
max_trips_count = daily_trips.max()

print(f"The date with the most completed trips was {max_trips_date} with {max_trips_count} trips.")
```

#### 2. What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
**Approach:** This requires calculating a rolling sum over a 24-hour window, not a fixed calendar day. The `rolling()` function in pandas is ideal for this.

```python
# Calculate the 24-hour rolling sum of completed trips
rolling_24hr_trips = df['Completed Trips'].rolling(window=24).sum()

# Find the maximum value in this rolling sum series
max_24hr_trips = rolling_24hr_trips.max()

print(f"The highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period was {int(max_24hr_trips)}.")
```

#### 3. Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
**Approach:** Group the data by the `Time (Local)` (hour of the day), sum the `Requests` for each hour across all days, and find the hour with the highest total.

```python
# Group by hour and sum requests
hourly_requests = df.groupby('Time (Local)')['Requests'].sum()

# Find the hour with the maximum requests
busiest_hour = hourly_requests.idxmax()
request_count = hourly_requests.max()

print(f"The hour of the day with the most requests was hour {busiest_hour} (from {busiest_hour}:00 to {busiest_hour+1}:00), with a total of {request_count} requests.")
```

#### 4. What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
**Approach:** First, define the weekend period using a boolean mask. Then, sum the `Zeroes` within this period and divide by the total sum of `Zeroes` over the entire dataset.

```python
# Define the weekend period
# Friday (day 4) at or after 17:00
fri_mask = (df['day_of_week'] == 4) & (df['Time (Local)'] >= 17)
# All of Saturday (day 5)
sat_mask = (df['day_of_week'] == 5)
# Sunday (day 6) before 03:00
sun_mask = (df['day_of_week'] == 6) & (df['Time (Local)'] < 3)

weekend_mask = fri_mask | sat_mask | sun_mask

# Calculate zeroes during the weekend
weekend_zeroes = df[weekend_mask]['Zeroes'].sum()
# Calculate total zeroes
total_zeroes = df['Zeroes'].sum()

# Calculate the percentage
percentage_weekend_zeroes = (weekend_zeroes / total_zeroes) * 100

print(f"The percentage of all zeroes that occurred on the weekend is: {percentage_weekend_zeroes:.2f}%")
```

#### 5. What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period?
**Approach:** Calculate the hourly ratio of `Completed Trips` to `Unique Drivers`. Then, compute the weighted average of this ratio, using `Requests` as the weight for each hour. This accounts for the volume of activity in each hour.

```python
# Calculate the hourly ratio, filling NaNs (from 0 drivers) with 0
df['trips_per_driver'] = (df['Completed Trips'] / df['Unique Drivers']).fillna(0)

# Calculate the weighted average, using Requests as weights
weighted_avg_ratio = np.average(df['trips_per_driver'], weights=df['Requests'])

print(f"The weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver is: {weighted_avg_ratio:.2f}")
```

#### 6. In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hours shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts in every 8 hours.
**Approach:** Define fixed 8-hour shifts (00:00-07:59, 08:00-15:59, 16:00-23:59). Group the data by these shifts, sum the `Requests`, and identify the busiest one.

```python
# Define shifts using integer division
# Shift 0: 0-7, Shift 1: 8-15, Shift 2: 16-23
df['shift'] = df['Time (Local)'] // 8

# Group by shift and sum requests
shift_busyness = df.groupby('shift')['Requests'].sum()

# Find the busiest shift
busiest_shift_id = shift_busyness.idxmax()
shift_map = {
    0: "00:00 - 08:00",
    1: "08:00 - 16:00",
    2: "16:00 - 24:00"
}

print(f"The busiest 8-hour shift is from {shift_map[busiest_shift_id]}.")
```

#### 7. True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period.
**Approach:** The best way to verify this is to visualize `Unique Drivers` (supply) and `Requests` (demand) over time. If we can find a single instance where demand goes up but supply goes down or stays flat, the statement is false.

```python
# Plotting supply vs. demand
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.plot(df.index, df['Requests'], label='Requests (Demand)', color='blue', alpha=0.8)
plt.plot(df.index, df['Unique Drivers'], label='Unique Drivers (Supply)', color='green', alpha=0.8)

plt.title('Supply (Drivers) vs. Demand (Requests) Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date and Time')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

print("False. The visualization shows several instances where demand (blue line) spikes, but supply (green line) does not immediately follow or sometimes even dips. For example, during sharp weekday morning commute peaks, supply often lags behind the initial surge in demand.")
```

#### 8. In which 72 hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
**Approach:** Use a rolling window of 72 hours to calculate the sum of `Zeroes` and `Eyeballs`. Compute their ratio for each window and find the period with the maximum ratio.

```python
# Calculate rolling sums over a 72-hour window
rolling_zeroes = df['Zeroes'].rolling(window=72).sum()
rolling_eyeballs = df['Eyeballs'].rolling(window=72).sum()

# Calculate the ratio, avoiding division by zero
rolling_ratio = (rolling_zeroes / rolling_eyeballs).fillna(0)

# Find the end time of the period with the highest ratio
max_ratio_end_time = rolling_ratio.idxmax()
max_ratio_start_time = max_ratio_end_time - pd.to_timedelta(71, unit='h')

print(f"The 72-hour period with the highest Zeroes-to-Eyeballs ratio is from {max_ratio_start_time} to {max_ratio_end_time}.")
```

#### 9. If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to?
**Approach:** The goal is to add drivers where they are most needed. A good indicator of need is a high ratio of `Zeroes` to `Eyeballs`, as this represents the highest rate of user disappointment. We'll find the hour of the day that has the highest average `Zeroes` / `Eyeballs` ratio.

```python
# Group by hour to get total Zeroes and Eyeballs
hourly_stats = df.groupby('Time (Local)')[['Zeroes', 'Eyeballs']].sum()

# Calculate the Zeroes per Eyeball ratio for each hour
hourly_stats['zero_eyeball_ratio'] = (hourly_stats['Zeroes'] / hourly_stats['Eyeballs']).fillna(0)

# Find the hour with the highest ratio
worst_hour = hourly_stats['zero_eyeball_ratio'].idxmax()

print(f"The best hour to add 5 drivers would be hour {worst_hour}. This hour has the highest average ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs, indicating it's the time when users are most likely to open the app and see no cars available.")
```

#### 10. True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
**Approach:** Count the number of unique dates in the dataset. Two weeks is 14 days.

```python
# Count the number of unique dates
num_unique_dates = df['Date'].nunique()

is_two_weeks = num_unique_dates == 14

print(f"There are {num_unique_dates} unique dates in the dataset.")
print(f"True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data? {is_two_weeks}.")
```

#### 11. Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight?
**Approach:** A "true end of day" is when both supply and demand are at their natural minimums. We can find this by calculating the average `Requests` and `Unique Drivers` for each hour of the day and plotting them. The trough in both lines will indicate the best time.

```python
# Group by hour and calculate the mean for supply and demand indicators
hourly_averages = df.groupby('Time (Local)')[['Requests', 'Unique Drivers']].mean()

# Plot the hourly averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(hourly_averages.index, hourly_averages['Requests'], label='Average Requests (Demand)', marker='o')
plt.plot(hourly_averages.index, hourly_averages['Unique Drivers'], label='Average Unique Drivers (Supply)', marker='o')

plt.title('Average Supply and Demand by Hour of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day (Local Time)')
plt.ylabel('Average Count')
plt.xticks(np.arange(0, 24, 1))
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--')
plt.show()

natural_minimum_hour = (hourly_averages['Requests'] + hourly_averages['Unique Drivers']).idxmin()
print(f"The visualization shows that both supply and demand consistently reach their lowest point around hour {natural_minimum_hour}. Therefore, {natural_minimum_hour}:00 AM would be a more logical 'end of day' than midnight.")
```
