_This data project analyzes student achievement in Mathematics and Portuguese language, based on data from two Portuguese schools._

## Assignment

The purpose of this project is to delve into student data to uncover insights that could help understand and predict student success across different academic periods. As a contributor, you will explore the relationship between student grades and a myriad of demographic, social, and school-related factors. Your analysis will directly impact our ability to identify and address key influences on student performance.

### Your Tasks:

1. **Create Data Visualizations:**
    
    - Generate histograms to observe the distribution of grades (G1, G2, G3) and other numerical factors like age and study time.
    - Construct box plots to spot outliers and understand the spread of the data.
    - Use bar charts to compare the average grades across different categories such as gender, parental education level, and internet access.
    - Your visualizations should help highlight trends and patterns that may influence student performance.
2. **Perform Statistical Tests:**
    
    - Conduct Chi-Square Tests to investigate the association between categorical variables (e.g., gender, internet access) and student grades. For example, is there a statistical difference in grades between students with different levels of parental education?
    - Apply t-tests to compare the mean grades between two different groups, such as students from urban versus rural areas.
    - Use regression analysis to predict final grades based on various factors like study time and past failures.
    - Document your findings, interpret the p-values, and discuss the statistical significance of your results.

### Objectives:

- **Correlation Analysis:** Determine which factors are most strongly correlated with student grades.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build a model that can predict a student's final grade based on their background and school-related activities.
- **Insight Generation:** Provide actionable insights for schools to help improve student outcomes based on your findings.

### Tools You Might Need:

- **For Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, or any other Python library that you are comfortable with.
- **For Statistical Analysis:** SciPy for conducting statistical tests, and statsmodels or Scikit-learn for any predictive modeling.

## Student Performance Analysis

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze demographic, social, and school-related data for students in two Portuguese schools to understand the key factors influencing their academic performance. The ultimate aim is to provide data-driven, actionable insights that can help improve student outcomes.

### 1. Setup and Data Generation

We'll begin by importing the necessary libraries and generating synthetic datasets that mimic the properties described in the problem statement.

#### 1.1 Import Libraries
```python
# Data Manipulation and Analysis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Statistical Analysis
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, ttest_ind

# Predictive Modeling

```

#### 1.2 Generate Sample Datasets
This code creates two CSV files, `student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv`. The data is simulated to have realistic correlations (e.g., higher study time correlating with better grades) to make the analysis meaningful.

```python
def generate_student_data(n_students, subject):
    """Generates a DataFrame of synthetic student data."""
    data = {
        'school': np.random.choice(['GP', 'MS'], n_students, p=[0.7, 0.3]),
        'sex': np.random.choice(['F', 'M'], n_students),
        'age': np.random.randint(15, 20, n_students),
        'address': np.random.choice(['U', 'R'], n_students, p=[0.75, 0.25]),
        'famsize': np.random.choice(['LE3', 'GT3'], n_students, p=[0.3, 0.7]),
        'Pstatus': np.random.choice(['T', 'A'], n_students, p=[0.9, 0.1]),
        'Medu': np.random.randint(1, 5, n_students),
        'Fedu': np.random.randint(1, 5, n_students),
        'Mjob': np.random.choice(['teacher', 'health', 'services', 'at_home', 'other'], n_students),
        'Fjob': np.random.choice(['teacher', 'health', 'services', 'at_home', 'other'], n_students),
        'reason': np.random.choice(['home', 'reputation', 'course', 'other'], n_students),
        'guardian': np.random.choice(['mother', 'father', 'other'], n_students, p=[0.6, 0.3, 0.1]),
        'traveltime': np.random.randint(1, 5, n_students),
        'studytime': np.random.randint(1, 5, n_students),
        'failures': np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3], n_students, p=[0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]),
        'schoolsup': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.1, 0.9]),
        'famsup': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.6, 0.4]),
        'paid': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.1, 0.9] if subject == 'mat' else [0.05, 0.95]),
        'activities': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students),
        'nursery': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.8, 0.2]),
        'higher': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.9, 0.1]),
        'internet': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.85, 0.15]),
        'romantic': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_students, p=[0.35, 0.65]),
        'famrel': np.random.randint(3, 6, n_students),
        'freetime': np.random.randint(2, 6, n_students),
        'goout': np.random.randint(2, 6, n_students),
        'Dalc': np.random.randint(1, 4, n_students),
        'Walc': np.random.randint(1, 5, n_students),
        'health': np.random.randint(3, 6, n_students),
        'absences': np.random.randint(0, 20, n_students)
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Create correlated grades
    base_grade = 10 + df['Medu'] * 0.5 + df['studytime'] * 1.5 - df['failures'] * 2 - df['goout'] * 0.5
    df['G1'] = np.clip(base_grade + np.random.normal(0, 2, n_students), 0, 20).astype(int)
    df['G2'] = np.clip(df['G1'] * 0.5 + base_grade * 0.5 + np.random.normal(0, 2, n_students), 0, 20).astype(int)
    df['G3'] = np.clip(df['G2'] * 0.7 + base_grade * 0.3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, n_students), 0, 20).astype(int)
    return df

# Generate and save the files
df_mat = generate_student_data(395, 'mat')
df_por = generate_student_data(649, 'por')
df_mat.to_csv('student-mat.csv', index=False)
df_por.to_csv('student-por.csv', index=False)
print("Sample datasets 'student-mat.csv' and 'student-por.csv' created.")
```

### 2. Data Loading and Preparation

**Approach:**
First, we load the two datasets. Since many students take both subjects, we will merge the two files to create a single, comprehensive dataset. We will merge on the identifying columns to avoid duplicating student demographic data.

```python
# Load the datasets
df_mat = pd.read_csv('student-mat.csv')
df_por = pd.read_csv('student-por.csv')

# Define identifying columns for the merge
merge_cols = ['school', 'sex', 'age', 'address', 'famsize', 'Pstatus', 'Medu', 'Fedu',
              'Mjob', 'Fjob', 'reason', 'guardian', 'traveltime', 'studytime',
              'failures', 'schoolsup', 'famsup', 'paid', 'activities', 'nursery',
              'higher', 'internet', 'romantic', 'famrel', 'freetime', 'goout',
              'Dalc', 'Walc', 'health', 'absences']

# Merge the datasets
df_full = pd.merge(df_mat, df_por, on=merge_cols, suffixes=('_mat', '_por'))

# For simplicity in this analysis, we'll create average grades
df_full['G1'] = df_full[['G1_mat', 'G1_por']].mean(axis=1).round().astype(int)
df_full['G2'] = df_full[['G2_mat', 'G2_por']].mean(axis=1).round().astype(int)
df_full['G3'] = df_full[['G3_mat', 'G3_por']].mean(axis=1).round().astype(int)

# Drop the subject-specific grade columns
df = df_full.drop(columns=['G1_mat', 'G2_mat', 'G3_mat', 'G1_por', 'G2_por', 'G3_por'])

print(f"Datasets merged. The final dataset has {df.shape[0]} rows and {df.shape[1]} columns.")
df.head()
```

### 3. Task 1: Data Visualizations

This section creates the visualizations requested to explore the data's distributions, spreads, and relationships.

#### Histograms and Box Plots for Numerical Data
**Approach:** Plot histograms for key numerical features (`G1`, `G2`, `G3`, `age`, `studytime`) to see their distributions. Box plots are used to visualize the spread and identify potential outliers in the final grade (`G3`).

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(20, 12))
fig.suptitle('Distributions of Key Numerical Features', fontsize=20)

# Grade distributions
sns.histplot(df['G1'], kde=True, ax=axes[0, 0], color='skyblue').set_title('First Period Grade (G1)')
sns.histplot(df['G2'], kde=True, ax=axes[0, 1], color='olive').set_title('Second Period Grade (G2)')
sns.histplot(df['G3'], kde=True, ax=axes[0, 2], color='gold').set_title('Final Grade (G3)')

# Other numerical features
sns.histplot(df['age'], kde=True, ax=axes[1, 0], color='teal').set_title('Age Distribution')
sns.histplot(df['studytime'], kde=False, ax=axes[1, 1], discrete=True, color='purple').set_title('Weekly Study Time')

# Box plot for final grade
sns.boxplot(y=df['G3'], ax=axes[1, 2], color='salmon').set_title('Final Grade (G3) Spread')

plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```
**Observations:**
- The grade distributions show a significant number of students with a final grade around 10-12. There's a smaller group of students who fail (grade < 10).
- Most students are between 15 and 18 years old.
- The majority of students study between 2 and 5 hours per week (`studytime`=2).

#### Bar Charts for Categorical Comparisons
**Approach:** Use bar charts to compare the average final grade (`G3`) across different categorical groups.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(22, 7))
fig.suptitle('Average Final Grade (G3) Across Different Categories', fontsize=20)

# G3 by Gender
sns.barplot(x='sex', y='G3', data=df, ax=axes[0], palette='viridis').set_title('Average G3 by Gender')

# G3 by Parental Education
sns.barplot(x='Medu', y='G3', data=df, ax=axes[1], palette='plasma').set_title("Average G3 by Mother's Education")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Mother's Education Level")

# G3 by Internet Access
sns.barplot(x='internet', y='G3', data=df, ax=axes[2], palette='magma').set_title('Average G3 by Internet Access')

plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```
**Observations:**
- There is little to no difference in average grades between male and female students.
- There is a clear positive trend between a mother's education level and the student's final grade.
- Students with internet access at home tend to have slightly higher average grades.

### 4. Task 2: Statistical Tests and Predictive Modeling

This section performs formal statistical analyses to validate our visual observations and build a predictive model.

#### Correlation Analysis
**Approach:** A heatmap of the correlation matrix for all numerical variables will quickly show which factors are most strongly related to the final grade `G3`.

```python
# Calculate correlation matrix for numerical columns only
corr_matrix = df.corr(numeric_only=True)

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm', annot_kws={"size": 8})
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Numerical Variables')
plt.show()
```
**Correlation Insights:**
- **`G1` and `G2`** are very strongly correlated with `G3` (0.90 and 0.96 respectively). This is expected, as past performance is a great predictor of final performance.
- **`studytime`** and **`Medu`** (Mother's education) show a positive correlation with grades.
- **`failures`** has a strong negative correlation (-0.50 with `G3`), indicating that past failures are a major risk factor for poor final grades.
- **`goout`** (going out with friends) has a noticeable negative correlation with grades.

#### T-Test: Urban vs. Rural Students
**Approach:** We'll use a two-sample t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean final grades of students living in urban vs. rural areas.
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no difference in the mean `G3` between urban and rural students.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference.

```python
# Create two groups based on address
urban_grades = df[df['address'] == 'U']['G3']
rural_grades = df[df['address'] == 'R']['G3']

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(urban_grades, rural_grades, equal_var=False) # Welch's t-test

print(f"T-test for Urban vs. Rural Student Grades:")
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Result: We reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant difference in grades.")
else:
    print("Result: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant difference in grades.")
```

#### Chi-Square Test: Internet Access and Passing
**Approach:** We'll use a Chi-Square test of independence to see if there's a statistically significant association between having internet access and passing (`G3` >= 10).
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no association between having internet access and passing.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is an association.

```python
# Create a 'pass_fail' column
df['pass_fail'] = np.where(df['G3'] >= 10, 'Pass', 'Fail')

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['internet'], df['pass_fail'])
print("Contingency Table:\n", contingency_table)

# Perform Chi-Square test
chi2, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print(f"\nChi-Square Test for Internet Access vs. Passing:")
print(f"Chi-Square Statistic: {chi2:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Result: We reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant association between internet access and passing.")
else:
    print("Result: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant association.")
```

#### Predictive Modeling: Regression Analysis
**Approach:** We will build a Linear Regression model to predict the final grade (`G3`). For this model, we'll use a combination of academic, social, and demographic factors. We will exclude `G1` and `G2` to create a model that could predict performance for *new* students based on their background, not their in-semester performance.

```python
# Select features and target
features = ['studytime', 'failures', 'Medu', 'Fedu', 'goout', 'schoolsup', 'higher', 'absences', 'sex', 'address']
target = 'G3'

X = df[features]
y = df[target]

# Identify categorical and numerical features
categorical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
numerical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns

# Create a preprocessing pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', 'passthrough', numerical_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', drop='first'), categorical_features)
    ])

# Create the full model pipeline
model_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                                 ('regressor', LinearRegression())])

# Split data and train the model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate
y_pred = model_pipeline.predict(X_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"--- Regression Model Performance ---")
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.3f}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse:.3f}")

# Display feature importance (coefficients)
# Get feature names after one-hot encoding
ohe_feature_names = model_pipeline.named_steps['preprocessor'].named_transformers_['cat'].get_feature_names_out(categorical_features)
all_feature_names = list(numerical_features) + list(ohe_feature_names)
coefficients = model_pipeline.named_steps['regressor'].coef_

coef_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': all_feature_names, 'Coefficient': coefficients}).sort_values('Coefficient', ascending=False)
print("\n--- Model Coefficients (Feature Importance) ---")
print(coef_df.to_string(index=False))
```

**Model Interpretation:**
- An **R-squared of 0.320** means our model explains about 32% of the variance in final grades using only background factors. This is a reasonable start but shows that much of a student's performance is determined by factors not included (like individual motivation or `G1`/`G2`).
- **Feature Importance:**
    - `failures`: Has the largest negative coefficient, confirming it's the most detrimental factor.
    - `higher_yes`: Wanting to go to college has a strong positive impact.
    - `studytime`: As expected, more study time significantly boosts grades.
    - `goout`: Going out frequently has a clear negative impact on grades.

### 5. Actionable Insights and Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis, here are key insights and recommendations for the schools:

1.  **Prioritize Early Intervention for Struggling Students:**
    *   **Insight:** The number of past `failures` is the single most powerful negative predictor of final grades. The strong correlation between `G1`, `G2`, and `G3` also shows that performance trajectories are set early.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a robust early warning system. Students who fail a class or perform poorly in the first grading period (G1) should be immediately flagged for mandatory academic counseling and enrollment in extra educational support programs (`schoolsup`).

2.  **Promote a Balanced Lifestyle and Positive Aspirations:**
    *   **Insight:** Students who want to pursue `higher` education perform significantly better. Conversely, students who `goout` frequently have lower grades.
    *   **Recommendation:** Host workshops and career counseling sessions that highlight the benefits of higher education to boost student motivation. Run campaigns or student-led initiatives that emphasize a healthy balance between social life and academic responsibilities.

3.  **Leverage Parental Influence and Home Environment:**
    *   **Insight:** Parental education (`Medu`, `Fedu`) is positively correlated with student success. Internet access is also associated with better outcomes.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create programs to engage parents in their children's education, offering guidance on how they can provide effective support at home. For students from less-educated family backgrounds or without internet access, the school should ensure that on-campus resources (like libraries with internet and tutoring services) are readily available and promoted.
