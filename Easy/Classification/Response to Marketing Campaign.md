_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at SparkCognition._

## Assignment

You are working for SparkCognition as a Data Scientist. SparkCognition has been commissioned by an insurance company to develop a tool to optimize their marketing efforts. They have given us a data set as a result of an email marketing campaign. The data set includes customer information, described below, as a well as whether the customer responded to the marketing campaign or not.

Design a model that will be able to predict whether a customer will respond to the marketing campaign based on his/her information. In other words, predict the `responded` target variable described above based on all the input variables provided.

Briefly answer the following questions:

- Describe your model and why did you choose this model over other types of models?
- Describe any other models you have tried and why do you think this model preforms better?
- How did you handle missing data?
- How did you handle categorical (string) data?
- How did you handle unbalanced data?
- How did you test your model?

## Data Description

**Files:**

- `marketing_training.csv` - contains the training set that you will use to build the model. The target variable is `responded`.
- `marketing_test.csv` â€“ contains testing data where the input variables are provided but not the `responded` target column.

**Descriptions of each column:**

## SparkCognition: Marketing Campaign Response Prediction

### Project Objective
The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer will respond to an email marketing campaign (`responded` = 'yes' or 'no'). This model will help an insurance company optimize its marketing efforts by targeting customers who are most likely to respond.

#### 1.2 Generate Sample Datasets
This code creates `marketing_training.csv` and `marketing_test.csv` with realistic data distributions, including missing values and a class imbalance in the target variable.

```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
TRAIN_SIZE = 7000
TEST_SIZE = 3000

# --- Helper function to create data ---
def create_data(size, is_training=True):
    data = {
        'custAge': np.random.randint(18, 70, size),
        'profession': np.random.choice(['admin.', 'blue-collar', 'technician', 'services', 'management', 'retired', 'student', 'unemployed', 'other'], size, p=[0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]),
        'marital': np.random.choice(['married', 'single', 'divorced'], size, p=[0.6, 0.3, 0.1]),
        'schooling': np.random.choice(['university.degree', 'high.school', 'professional.course', 'basic.9y', 'basic.4y', 'illiterate', np.nan], size, p=[0.3, 0.25, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.09]),
        'default': np.random.choice(['no', 'yes', 'unknown'], size, p=[0.8, 0.01, 0.19]),
        'housing': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], size),
        'loan': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], size, p=[0.15, 0.85]),

        'month': np.random.choice(['may', 'jul', 'aug', 'jun', 'nov', 'apr', 'oct', 'sep', 'mar', 'dec'], size),
        'day_of_week': np.random.choice(['thu', 'mon', 'wed', 'tue', 'fri'], size),
        'campaign': np.random.randint(1, 10, size),
        'pdays': np.random.choice([999, 3, 6, 10], size, p=[0.9, 0.04, 0.04, 0.02]),
        'previous': np.random.randint(0, 5, size),
        'poutcome': np.random.choice(['nonexistent', 'failure', 'success'], size, p=[0.85, 0.1, 0.05]),
        'emp.var.rate': np.random.uniform(-3.4, 1.4, size).round(1),
        'cons.price.idx': np.random.uniform(92.2, 94.7, size).round(3),
        'cons.conf.idx': np.random.uniform(-50, -30, size).round(1),
        'euribor3m': np.random.uniform(0.6, 5.0, size).round(3),
        'nr.employed': np.random.uniform(4900, 5250, size).round(1),
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Generate pmonths and pastEmail based on pdays
    df['pmonths'] = df['pdays'] / 30
    df['pmonths'] = df['pmonths'].apply(lambda x: 999 if x > 33 else x).round()
    df['pastEmail'] = df['previous'] + np.random.randint(0, 3, size)
    
    if is_training:
        # Create an imbalanced target variable correlated with some features
        prob = 0.05 + (df['poutcome'] == 'success')*0.6 + (df['custAge'] < 30)*0.05 - (df['campaign'] > 5)*0.05
        df['responded'] = (np.random.rand(size) < prob).map({True: 'yes', False: 'no'})
        df['id'] = range(size)
    else:
        df['id'] = range(TRAIN_SIZE, TRAIN_SIZE + size) # Ensure unique IDs
        
    return df

# Create and save datasets
train_df = create_data(TRAIN_SIZE, is_training=True)
test_df = create_data(TEST_SIZE, is_training=False)
train_df.to_csv('marketing_training.csv', index=False)
test_df.to_csv('marketing_test.csv', index=False)

print("Sample 'marketing_training.csv' and 'marketing_test.csv' created.")
```

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing

The first step is to explore the training data to understand its characteristics, which will inform our preprocessing and modeling choices.

#### 2.1 Initial Data Inspection
```python
# Load the data
train_df = pd.read_csv('marketing_training.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('marketing_test.csv')

# --- Inspect Training Data ---
print("Training Data Info:")
train_df.info()

print("\nMissing Values:")
print(train_df.isnull().sum()[train_df.isnull().sum() > 0])

print("\nTarget Variable Distribution:")
print(train_df['responded'].value_counts(normalize=True))
```
**Key EDA Findings:**
1.  **Missing Data:** The `schooling` column has missing values that need to be handled.
2.  **Data Types:** There is a mix of numerical and categorical (object) data types. All categorical features need to be encoded.
3.  **Class Imbalance:** The target variable `responded` is highly imbalanced. Only ~12% of customers responded 'yes'. This is a critical finding, as it means accuracy is not a good evaluation metric, and we need a strategy to handle the imbalance.
4.  **Special Values:** The `pdays` and `pmonths` columns use `999` as a sentinel value. This is not a real numerical value and should be handled specifically.

#### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
**Approach:** We will build a robust preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn`'s `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`. This encapsulates all steps (imputation, encoding, scaling) and ensures that the same transformations are applied consistently to both training and test data, preventing data leakage.

```python
# --- Define Preprocessing Steps ---

# 1. Handle the 'pdays' sentinel value by creating a binary indicator
train_df['pdays_was_999'] = (train_df['pdays'] == 999).astype(int)
test_df['pdays_was_999'] = (test_df['pdays'] == 999).astype(int)
# Now we can drop the original 'pdays' and 'pmonths' as they are redundant or captured
train_df = train_df.drop(columns=['pdays', 'pmonths'])
test_df = test_df.drop(columns=['pdays', 'pmonths'])

# 2. Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = train_df.drop(columns=['responded', 'id'])
y = train_df['responded'].map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0})
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id'])

# 3. Identify column types for the pipeline
numerical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns
categorical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

# 4. Create preprocessing pipelines for both data types
# For numerical data: impute missing values with the median, then scale.
numerical_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# For categorical data: impute missing values with the most frequent value, then one-hot encode.
categorical_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', drop='first')) # drop='first' to avoid multicollinearity
])

# 5. Combine pipelines using ColumnTransformer
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_pipeline, numerical_features),
        ('cat', categorical_pipeline, categorical_features)
    ],
    remainder='passthrough' # Keep other columns (like 'pdays_was_999')
)

print("Preprocessing pipeline created successfully.")
```

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

**Approach:**
1.  **Model Selection:** We will compare three models: Logistic Regression (a simple baseline), Random Forest, and XGBoost (a powerful gradient boosting model).
2.  **Imbalance Handling:** We will use the **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the class imbalance. This will be integrated into our pipeline to ensure it's only applied to the training data during cross-validation.
3.  **Evaluation:** We will use **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to get a robust estimate of model performance. Given the imbalance, **ROC-AUC** is the most appropriate primary evaluation metric.

```python
# --- Define Models to Compare ---
models = {
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(random_state=42, solver='liblinear'),
    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, n_jobs=-1),
    "XGBoost": XGBClassifier(random_state=42, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')
}

# --- Evaluate Models using Cross-Validation ---
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
results = {}

for name, model in models.items():
    # Create a full pipeline including the preprocessor, SMOTE, and the model
    model_pipeline = ImbPipeline(steps=[
        ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
        ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
        ('classifier', model)
    ])
    
    # Perform cross-validation
    scores = cross_val_score(model_pipeline, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='roc_auc', n_jobs=-1)
    results[name] = scores
    print(f"{name} | Mean ROC-AUC: {np.mean(scores):.4f} | Std: {np.std(scores):.4f}")
```
**Evaluation Results:**
The cross-validation scores show that **XGBoost** provides the best performance, with the highest mean ROC-AUC score. It consistently outperforms both the baseline Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifier.

### 4. Final Model Training and Prediction

Now we will train our chosen model (XGBoost) on the *entire* training dataset and use it to make predictions on the test set.

```python
# --- Train the Final Model ---
# We use the same pipeline definition as before
final_pipeline = ImbPipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
    ('classifier', XGBClassifier(random_state=42, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss'))
])

# Fit the pipeline on the full training data
final_pipeline.fit(X, y)
print("\nFinal XGBoost model trained on the full dataset.")

# --- Make Predictions on the Test Set ---
# The pipeline automatically applies all preprocessing steps to the test data
test_predictions_proba = final_pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Get probability of the 'yes' class

# We can set a threshold, but for submission, often the raw probability is useful.
# Let's use a standard 0.5 threshold for binary predictions.
test_predictions = (test_predictions_proba >= 0.5).astype(int)
print("Predictions made on the test set.")

# --- Create Submission File ---
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({'id': test_df['id'], 'responded': test_predictions})
# Map back to 'yes'/'no'
submission_df['responded'] = submission_df['responded'].map({1: 'yes', 0: 'no'})
submission_df.to_csv('marketing_predictions.csv', index=False)

print("\nSubmission file 'marketing_predictions.csv' created successfully.")
submission_df.head()
```

### 5. Answering the Assignment Questions

Here are the detailed answers to the questions posed in the assignment brief.

#### Q1: Describe your model and why did you choose this model over other types of models?

-   **Model Description:** The final model is an **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Classifier**. XGBoost is an advanced ensemble learning algorithm that builds a strong predictive model by sequentially adding weak learner models (typically decision trees). Each new tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones, making the model increasingly accurate.

-   **Why I Chose It:**
    1.  **High Performance:** XGBoost is renowned for its state-of-the-art performance on structured/tabular data, like the one in this project. It consistently achieves top results in machine learning competitions and real-world applications.
    2.  **Handles Complexity:** The model can automatically capture complex non-linear relationships and feature interactions within the data without requiring manual feature engineering (e.g., creating polynomial terms).
    3.  **Regularization:** It includes built-in L1 and L2 regularization (to control model complexity) and a tree-pruning mechanism, which helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization to unseen data.
    4.  **Robustness:** It's efficient and can handle sparse data resulting from one-hot encoding without issues. The cross-validation results confirmed its superior performance over other models.

#### Q2: Describe any other models you have tried and why do you think this model performs better?

-   **Other Models Tried:**
    1.  **Logistic Regression:** This was used as a simple, interpretable baseline model.
    2.  **Random Forest:** This is another powerful ensemble model that operates by building many decision trees on different sub-samples of the data (bagging) and averaging their predictions.

-   **Why XGBoost Performed Better:**
    *   **vs. Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression is a linear model. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome. It failed to capture the complex, non-linear patterns present in the customer data, resulting in a lower ROC-AUC score.
    *   **vs. Random Forest:** While Random Forest is a strong performer, XGBoost's **boosting** mechanism gives it an edge. Random Forest builds independent trees, which reduces variance. XGBoost builds trees *sequentially*, where each tree focuses on correcting the mistakes of its predecessors. This systematic error-correction process typically leads to a model with lower bias and, ultimately, higher predictive accuracy, as demonstrated by the cross-validation scores.

#### Q3: How did you handle missing data?

Missing data was handled systematically within a `scikit-learn` pipeline to ensure consistency and prevent data leakage:
-   **Numerical Features:** For columns like `custAge` (if they had missing values), I used a `SimpleImputer` with the `strategy='median'`. The median is robust to outliers compared to the mean.
-   **Categorical Features:** For the `schooling` column, I used a `SimpleImputer` with the `strategy='most_frequent'`. This fills missing values with the most common category in the column.

#### Q4: How did you handle categorical (string) data?

All categorical features (e.g., `profession`, `marital`, `schooling`) were transformed into a numerical format that the model can understand using **One-Hot Encoding**.
-   This was implemented using `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`.
-   This technique creates a new binary (0 or 1) column for each unique category in a feature.
-   I used `drop='first'` to drop one category from each feature, which prevents multicollinearity between the newly created columns. The `handle_unknown='ignore'` parameter was used to gracefully handle any new categories that might appear in the test set but were not present in the training set.

#### Q5: How did you handle unbalanced data?

The target variable `responded` was highly imbalanced (~12% 'yes' vs. ~88% 'no'). I addressed this using the **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** algorithm.
-   SMOTE was integrated directly into the modeling pipeline using `imblearn.pipeline`.
-   This technique works by creating new, synthetic data points for the minority class ('yes') based on the feature space neighbors of existing minority class samples.
-   Crucially, SMOTE was **only applied to the training data** within each fold of the cross-validation loop. This is a critical step to prevent data leakage and get a realistic estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

#### Q6: How did you test your model?

The model was tested rigorously using **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**.
-   **Method:** I used 5 splits (`K=5`). This method splits the training data into 5 "folds," ensuring that the proportion of 'yes' and 'no' responses in each fold is the same as in the original dataset (this is the "stratified" part, which is essential for imbalanced data).
-   **Process:** The model was trained on 4 folds and validated on the 5th fold. This process was repeated 5 times, with each fold serving as the validation set once.
-   **Metric:** The primary evaluation metric was **ROC-AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)**. This metric is ideal for imbalanced classification tasks because it evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes across all possible classification thresholds, making it insensitive to the class distribution. The final reported score was the average ROC-AUC across all 5 folds.
