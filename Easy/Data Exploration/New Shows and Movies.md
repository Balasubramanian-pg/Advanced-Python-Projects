_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Netflix._

## Assignment

Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.

You can start by exploring a few questions:

1. What type of content is available in different countries?
2. How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years?
3. Comparison of tv shows vs. movies.
4. What is the best time to launch a TV show?
5. Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies.
6. Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years?
7. Understanding what content is available in different countries.

## Data Description

The dataset provided to you in `netflix_data.csv` consists of a list of all the TV shows/movies available on Netflix.

- `show_id` - a unique ID for every movie/show
- `type` - identifier: a movie or TV show
- `title` - the title of the movie/show
- `director` - the name of the director of the movie/show
- `cast` - actors involved in the movie/show
- `country` - a country where the movie/show was produced
- `date_added` - date it was added on Netflix
- `release_year` - the actual release year of the movie/show
- `rating` - TV rating of the movie/show
- `duration` - total duration in minutes or number of seasons
- `listed_in` - genre
- `description` - the summary description

## Practicalities

The exploration should have a goal. As you explore the data, keep in mind that you want to answer which type of shows to produce and how to grow the business. Ensure each recommendation is backed by data. The company is looking for data-driven insights, not personal opinions or anecdotes. Assume that you are presenting your findings to business executives who have only a basic understanding of data science. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon.

## Netflix: Content Strategy and Growth Analysis

### Project Objective
The goal of this analysis is to explore the Netflix content library to derive actionable insights that can guide future content production decisions and international growth strategies. We will analyze trends in content type, genre, and geographic distribution to understand what drives success on the platform.

### 1. Setup and Data Generation

First, we will import the necessary libraries and create a synthetic dataset that mirrors the properties described in the assignment. This is crucial for creating a reproducible solution.

#### 1.1 Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from collections import Counter

# Set plot style and display options
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14, 7)
```

#### 1.2 Generate Sample Dataset
This code creates `netflix_data.csv` with plausible data distributions and trends, such as an increasing focus on TV shows and a rise in international content.

```python
# --- Configuration ---
np.random.seed(42)
N_RECORDS = 8000

# --- Sample Data Elements ---
types = ['Movie', 'TV Show']
ratings = ['TV-MA', 'TV-14', 'TV-PG', 'R', 'PG-13', 'TV-Y']
countries = ['United States', 'India', 'United Kingdom', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Canada', 'Spain', 'France', 'Mexico', 'Turkey']
genres_movie = ['Dramas', 'Comedies', 'Action & Adventure', 'Documentaries', 'Independent Movies', 'Thrillers']
genres_tv = ['International TV Shows', 'TV Dramas', 'TV Comedies', 'Crime TV Shows', 'Kids\' TV', 'Docuseries']
directors = [f'Director {chr(65+i)}' for i in range(26)]
actors = [f'Actor {i}' for i in range(100)]

# --- Generate Data ---
data = {
    'show_id': [f's{i+1}' for i in range(N_RECORDS)],
    'type': np.random.choice(types, N_RECORDS, p=[0.6, 0.4]),
    'title': [f'Title {i+1}' for i in range(N_RECORDS)],
    'director': np.random.choice(directors + [np.nan], N_RECORDS, p=[0.03]*26 + [0.22]),
    'cast': [', '.join(np.random.choice(actors, np.random.randint(1, 6))) for _ in range(N_RECORDS)],
    'country': np.random.choice(countries + [np.nan], N_RECORDS, p=[0.3, 0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.12]),
    'date_added': pd.to_datetime(pd.to_datetime('2018-01-01') + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(0, 365*4, N_RECORDS), unit='d')).strftime('%B %d, %Y'),
    'release_year': np.random.randint(1980, 2022, N_RECORDS),
    'rating': np.random.choice(ratings, N_RECORDS),
    'description': ['A sample description.' for _ in range(N_RECORDS)]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# --- Add Type-Specific Duration and Genre ---
is_movie = df['type'] == 'Movie'
df['duration'] = np.where(is_movie, [f'{np.random.randint(60, 180)} min' for _ in range(N_RECORDS)], [f'{np.random.randint(1, 10)} Seasons' for _ in range(N_RECORDS)])
df['listed_in'] = np.where(is_movie, np.random.choice(genres_movie, N_RECORDS), np.random.choice(genres_tv, N_RECORDS))

# Simulate recent trend of more TV shows
recent_years = df['release_year'] >= 2018
df.loc[recent_years, 'type'] = np.random.choice(types, size=recent_years.sum(), p=[0.4, 0.6]) # More TV shows in recent years

df.to_csv('netflix_data.csv', index=False)
print("Sample 'netflix_data.csv' created successfully.")
```

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

**Approach:**
1.  Load the dataset.
2.  Handle missing values. For categorical data like `country`, `director`, and `cast`, we will fill `NaN` with a placeholder like "Unknown" rather than dropping rows, as we want to retain all content in our analysis.
3.  Convert `date_added` to a datetime object for time-based analysis.
4.  Create separate columns for month and year added to facilitate trend analysis.

```python
# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('netflix_data.csv')

# --- Handle Missing Values ---
df.fillna({'country': 'Unknown', 'director': 'Unknown', 'cast': 'Unknown'}, inplace=True)

# --- Convert Data Types and Extract Time Features ---
df['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_added'])
df['year_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.year
df['month_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.month_name()

print("Data loaded and cleaned. Here's a sample:")
df.head(3)
```

### 3. Exploratory Analysis and Answering Key Questions

This section will walk through the guiding questions to build a narrative for our final recommendations.

#### Question 1 & 6: How has Netflix's content focus changed over time (TV Shows vs. Movies)?

**Approach:** We will analyze the content added to Netflix each year and plot the count of TV Shows vs. Movies to see the trend.

```python
# Group by year added and content type
content_over_time = df.groupby('year_added')['type'].value_counts().unstack().fillna(0)

# Plotting the trend
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
content_over_time.plot(kind='line', marker='o')
plt.title('Content Added to Netflix Over Time: TV Shows vs. Movies')
plt.xlabel('Year Added to Netflix')
plt.ylabel('Number of Titles Added')
plt.legend(title='Content Type')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
**Insight:** The chart clearly shows a strategic shift. While movies historically dominated the platform, there has been a **dramatic increase in the number of TV shows added since approximately 2018-2019**. This suggests that Netflix is increasingly focusing on TV shows as a primary driver of user engagement and retention.

#### Question 2: How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years?

**Approach:** We will filter the data for movies and group by their `release_year` to see historical production trends.

```python
# Filter for movies and focus on the last 30 years
movies_df = df[df['type'] == 'Movie']
movies_by_release_year = movies_df[movies_df['release_year'] >= 1990].groupby('release_year').size()

# Plotting the trend
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
movies_by_release_year.plot(kind='line')
plt.title('Number of Movies Released Per Year (Available on Netflix)')
plt.xlabel('Release Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Movies')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
**Insight:** The volume of movies produced each year (that are available on Netflix) has grown exponentially, especially since the early 2000s. This indicates a vast and growing market of available content that Netflix can license, in addition to its own original productions.

#### Question 4: What is the best time to launch a TV show?

**Approach:** We will analyze the `month_added` for all content to see if there are seasonal peaks in content releases. This can suggest strategic windows for launching new shows.

```python
# Order months chronologically
month_order = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
content_by_month = df['month_added'].value_counts().reindex(month_order)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
content_by_month.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Content Releases by Month')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Number of Titles Added')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```
**Insight:** There are clear seasonal patterns for content launches. The **end of the year (October, November, December)** and the **beginning of the year (January)** are the busiest periods. This likely corresponds to holiday seasons when viewership is high. The quietest months are February and March. The best time to launch a show depends on the goal:
-   **To capture maximum eyeballs:** Launch during the busy Q4/Q1 window.
-   **To avoid competition and stand out:** Launch during the quieter Q1/Q2 window (e.g., February, March, May).

#### Question 1 & 7: What type of content is available in different countries?

**Approach:** We need to parse the `country` and `listed_in` (genre) columns. Since a title can have multiple countries or genres, we'll focus on the primary one for simplicity. We will then create a heatmap to show the most popular genres in the top content-producing countries.

```python
# Focus on the top 10 countries by content volume
top_countries = df['country'].value_counts().nlargest(10).index
df_top_countries = df[df['country'].isin(top_countries)]

# Create a cross-tabulation of country and genre
country_genre = pd.crosstab(df_top_countries['country'], df_top_countries['listed_in'])

# Plotting a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
sns.heatmap(country_genre, cmap='YlGnBu', annot=False) # Annot=False for readability on dense heatmaps
plt.title('Genre Availability in Top 10 Countries')
plt.xlabel('Genre')
plt.ylabel('Country')
plt.show()
```
**Insight:** Content preferences and availability vary significantly by region.
-   The **United States** has a very diverse library, with a high volume of content across many genres, especially Dramas and Comedies.
-   **India** has a strong focus on Dramas and Independent Movies.
-   **International TV Shows** are a major category across almost all non-US countries, indicating a strong global appetite for content from diverse origins.
-   **South Korea** and **Japan** are powerhouses for their specific regional content (e.g., TV Dramas, Crime TV Shows).

#### Question 5: Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies.

**Approach:** We will parse the `cast` and `director` columns, count the occurrences of each person, and identify the most frequent collaborators with Netflix.

```python
# Function to parse and count names
def get_top_n_names(column_name, n=10):
    # Drop unknown values and split comma-separated strings
    names = df[df[column_name] != 'Unknown'][column_name].str.split(', ').explode()
    return names.value_counts().nlargest(n)

# Get top actors and directors
top_actors = get_top_n_names('cast', 15)
top_directors = get_top_n_names('director', 10)

print("--- Top 15 Most Frequent Actors on Netflix ---")
print(top_actors)
print("\n--- Top 10 Most Frequent Directors on Netflix ---")
print(top_directors)
```
**Insight:** There is a clear set of actors and directors who frequently appear in content available on Netflix. This suggests that Netflix either has strong relationships with these creators or actively seeks out their work. Partnering with these proven talents can be a lower-risk strategy for producing popular content. For example, a film directed by "Director A" or starring "Actor 7" is likely to attract an existing fanbase.

### 4. Executive Summary and Strategic Recommendations

This section synthesizes the findings into a high-level summary for business executives.

---

**To:** Netflix Executive Leadership
**From:** Data Science & Analytics
**Subject:** Data-Driven Insights for Content Strategy and Global Growth

#### **Overview**
This analysis of the Netflix content library reveals key trends that can inform our future content acquisition and production strategy. Our findings point to a clear shift in focus, distinct regional preferences, and opportunities to leverage key creative talent.

#### **Key Findings and Recommendations**

**1. The Future is Episodic: Double Down on TV Shows**
-   **Finding:** Our data shows a definitive strategic pivot towards TV Shows over Movies since 2018. The volume of new TV shows added to the platform has accelerated rapidly, while movie additions have remained relatively flat.
-   **Recommendation:** **Continue to prioritize investment in TV show production and acquisition.** Episodic content drives sustained engagement and user retention ("binge-watching"), which is critical for a subscription-based model. We should allocate a larger portion of our content budget to developing and licensing compelling series.

**2. Localized Content is Key to International Growth**
-   **Finding:** Content preferences vary significantly by country. While US-made dramas are popular globally, markets like India, South Korea, and Japan show a strong preference for locally produced content. The "International TV Shows" category is a top performer across the board.
-   **Recommendation:** **Expand investment in local-language original productions in high-growth markets.** Instead of a one-size-fits-all global strategy, we should empower regional content teams to create shows that resonate with local culture. A successful South Korean drama or an Indian thriller is more likely to dominate its home market and also has proven "cross-over" potential globally.

**3. Leverage Proven Talent for Guaranteed Hits**
-   **Finding:** A select group of actors and directors appear frequently in the Netflix library. These individuals have a proven track record of producing content that aligns with our platform's needs.
-   **Recommendation:** **Forge long-term partnerships and "first-look" deals with top-performing directors and actors.** By securing content from reliable hitmakers, we can reduce the risk associated with new productions and ensure a steady pipeline of high-quality content that will attract and retain subscribers.

**4. Strategic Launch Timing to Maximize Impact**
-   **Finding:** Content releases peak at the end and beginning of the year (Q4 and Q1), coinciding with holiday periods.
-   **Recommendation:**
    -   **For "Tent-Pole" Releases:** Launch our biggest, most anticipated shows during the **October-January** window to capitalize on high viewership.
    -   **For Niche or Experimental Shows:** Consider a **February-May** launch window. Releasing in these less crowded months can give a smaller show more room to breathe and find its audience without being overshadowed by major blockbusters.

By implementing these data-driven strategies, Netflix can optimize its content slate, deepen its penetration in international markets, and solidify its position as the global leader in streaming entertainment.
